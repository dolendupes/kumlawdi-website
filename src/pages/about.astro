          <p class="text-lg text-brand-gray leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Kumlawdi Foundation Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering young men and women through sports, mentorship, academic support, and leadership development. Founded with the belief that every young person deserves access to positive role models and opportunities, the foundation uses athletics—specifically football (Tampa Flex) and girls flag football (Lady YakPak)—as a powerful tool to build character, discipline, and confidence.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-brand-gray leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Through year-round programming that includes football skill development, weekly WR training sessions, small-group mentoring, academic coaching, and college exposure experiences, the Kumlawdi Foundation provides a safe, structured environment where students can grow on and off the field. Our mission is to remove barriers by offering affordable, high-quality training and mentorship, ensuring that no student is turned away due to financial hardship.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-brand-gray leading-relaxed mb-6">
            With a focus on underserved communities, we aim to improve academic readiness, social-emotional skills, and long-term outcomes for youth. By partnering with families, schools, and community organizations, The Kumlawdi Foundation continues to create pathways to success—helping students become leaders, scholars, and role models in their communities.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-secondary text-center italic">
            We build more than athletes. We build leaders.
